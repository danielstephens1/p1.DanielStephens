## Issues
1. Express Cook
   - a.	The design of the control panel includes “Express Cook” which allows for single button presses 1-6 that will cook food for the given selection. The problem with this is it doesn’t allow for specific time cooking. If you wanted to cook for 45 seconds, it would be impossible to set the timer for that duration
