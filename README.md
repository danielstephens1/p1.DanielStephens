## Issues

##### Express Cook
The design of the control panel includes “Express Cook” which allows for single button presses 1-6 that will cook food for the given selection. The problem with this is it doesn’t allow for specific time cooking. If you wanted to cook for 45 seconds, it would be impossible to set the timer for that duration.

### Auto Cook Buttons
The top 8 buttons allow a user to cook specific foods by sensing, however the buttons give little-to-no specification. The user doesn’t know how large the food can be for the microwave to cook successfully. 

### Flat Interface
For a person with a seeing disability, this microwave would be difficult to operate. All the buttons are flush with the panel and have no textile indicator as to which buttons are which. This makes it very difficult to be accurate with your selection.
