### Issues with Initial Design

##### Express Cook
The design of the control panel includes “Express Cook” which allows for single button presses 1-6 that will cook food for the given selection. The problem with this is it doesn’t allow for specific time cooking. If you wanted to cook for 45 seconds, it would be impossible to set the timer for that duration.

##### Auto Cook Buttons
The top 8 buttons allow a user to cook specific foods by sensing, however the buttons give little-to-no specification. The user doesn’t know how large the food can be for the microwave to cook successfully. 

##### Flat Interface
For a person with a seeing disability, this microwave would be difficult to operate. All the buttons are flush with the panel and have no textile indicator as to which buttons are which. This makes it very difficult to be accurate with your selection.

### Common Uses
- Reheating leftovers
- Cooking premade meals

The “Express Cook” feature is most useful when reheating leftover food. By pressing a single button, I can reheat cold food to a very hot temperature without any thought. The “Start” button also acts as an “add 30 seconds” button to quickly add 30 seconds to the timer.

### Rare Uses
- Softening butter
- Cooking popcorn/vegetables

The “Express Cook” feature is also very limiting, as certain things require more precision than others. When softening butter, I usually need only 10 seconds, but entering 10 seconds is impossible due to the “Express Cook” feature. Instead of 1 second when pressing the “1” button, it will select “1 minute”, making smaller timers impossible.

### Sequence of Actions
The most common sequence of actions is pressing an **_Express Cook_** button 1 - 6, followed by the **_Start_** button to add 30 seconds.
